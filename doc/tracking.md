# LibreCounter.org Tracking

In-depth information about tracking for GDPR compliance.

## Server Information

The LibreCounter.org domain is served in a Linode Nanode 1GB instance,
managed by the author, [Alex "pinchito" Fern√°ndez](https://pinchito.es/).

which stores IP addresses in its log files.

User agents are not stored.

nor Firefox's integrated protection report any trackers.
